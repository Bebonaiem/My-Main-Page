            <h1>The Binding Pact</h1>
            <p>By summoning a server, you agree to this unholy agreement. Read it carefully.</p>

        <section class="legal-content">
            <p><strong>Last updated: October 31, 2023.</strong> This is a template and not legal advice. Consult a legal professional for your actual Terms of Service.</p>

            <h3>1. Agreement to the Pact</h3>
            <p>By purchasing or using the services provided by Halloween Hosting ("The Coven", "we", "us"), you ("The Summoner", "you") agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this document. If you do not agree, do not summon our services.</p>

            <h3>2. Forbidden Arcana (Acceptable Use)</h3>
            <p>The Summoner agrees not to use our services for any of the following forbidden rituals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hosting, distributing, or linking to any illegal material.</li>
                <li>Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material.</li>
                <li>Malicious activities, including but not limited to DDoS attacks, port scanning, and spreading malware.</li>
                <li>CPU/resource abuse that negatively impacts other summoners on the same node.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Tributes and Offerings (Payments)</h3>
            <p>All services are billed on a recurring basis. Failure to pay your tribute on time will result in the suspension, and eventual banishment (termination), of your server. Refunds are only offered within the first 72 hours of the initial summoning, as per our money-back guarantee.</p>

            <h3>4. Banishment (Termination)</h3>
            <p>The Coven reserves the right to terminate your service at any time, with or without cause. Violation of this Binding Pact will result in immediate termination without refund. Upon termination, all your data will be cast into the void and will not be recoverable.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Amendments to the Pact</h3>
            <p>We may amend this pact from time to time by posting the revised version on our website. Continued use of our services after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms. We will notify you of major changes via email or raven.</p>
