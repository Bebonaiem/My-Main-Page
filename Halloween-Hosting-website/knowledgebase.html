                <summary>How quickly will my server be set up?</summary>
                <p>Your server is conjured instantly! As soon as your payment is processed, our automated system sets up your server and sends you the details. This usually takes less than a minute.</p>

                <summary>What kind of hardware do you use?</summary>
                <p>We use only top-tier, enterprise-grade hardware. This includes high-clock-speed AMD Ryzen and Intel Core i9 CPUs, ultra-fast NVMe SSD storage, and high-speed DDR4 RAM to ensure your games run without a hitch.</p>

                <p>We want you to be happy, not eternally bound. We offer a 72-hour, no-questions-asked money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with our service within the first three days, we will provide a full refund.</p>

                <p>Our Grimoire Control Panel includes a one-click installer for popular mod loaders (like Forge/Fabric for Minecraft) and modpacks. For manual installations, you can easily access your server files via our web-based file manager or an FTP client.</p>

                <summary>Can I upgrade my plan later?</summary>
                <p>Of course! You can upgrade your plan at any time directly from the client area. The upgrade is processed automatically, and you only pay the difference for the remaining time in your billing cycle. Your files and server IP will remain unchanged.</p>
